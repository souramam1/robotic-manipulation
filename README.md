# Robotic Manipulation

This is a the code from the robotic manipulation module lead by Ad Spiers available to 3rd year students. We spent 2 months putting together a series of programs aimed at controlling a 4-DOF robotic arm to complete several tasks. These were programmed using Matlab - with contributions from Maia Ramambason, Kert Laansalau and Abdal Alkilany - the relevant files are found the the CW folder.
